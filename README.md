# CSV to JSON Converter
This is a converter between CSV and JSON built on top of Python 2.7.

## Dependencies/Assumptions
- Python 2.7 standard libraries
- Nothing else!

## Usage
- Run `python ./convert.py sample.csv` to get the JSON formatted output for that CSV file.
- By default, it will print the result to the console, but you can use I/O redirection to save it to a file.
	- `python ./convert.py sample.csv > sample.json`
